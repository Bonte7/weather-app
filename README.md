# Live Example
https://bonte7.github.io/weather-app/

This app pulls local weather data from your current location (upon approval from your browser) and displays the current and 5 day forecast for the area. There is also search functionality so you can search for any city other than your current location. 

I've also implemented a graph that will display hourly temps on a given day when a forecast card in the 5-day section is clicked.
